# Django Vendor Management System

This project implements a Vendor Management System using Django and Django REST Framework. The system is designed to handle vendor profiles, track purchase orders, and calculate vendor performance metrics.

## Core Features

### 1. Vendor Profile Management

**Model Design:**
- Create a model to store vendor information, including name, contact details, address, and a unique vendor code.

**API Endpoints:**
- `POST /api/vendors/`: Create a new vendor.
- `GET /api/vendors/`: List all vendors.
- `GET /api/vendors/{vendor_id}/`: Retrieve a specific vendor's details.
- `PUT /api/vendors/{vendor_id}/`: Update a vendor's details.
- `DELETE /api/vendors/{vendor_id}/`: Delete a vendor.

### 2. Purchase Order Tracking

**Model Design:**
- Track purchase orders with fields like PO number, vendor reference, order date, items, quantity, and status.

**API Endpoints:**
- `POST /api/purchase_orders/`: Create a purchase order.
- `GET /api/purchase_orders/`: List all purchase orders with an option to filter by vendor.
- `GET /api/purchase_orders/{po_id}/`: Retrieve details of a specific purchase order.
- `PUT /api/purchase_orders/{po_id}/`: Update a purchase order.
- `DELETE /api/purchase_orders/{po_id}/`: Delete a purchase order.

### 3. Vendor Performance Evaluation

**Metrics:**
- On-Time Delivery Rate: Percentage of orders delivered by the promised date.
- Quality Rating: Average of quality ratings given to a vendorâ€™s purchase orders.
- Response Time: Average time taken by a vendor to acknowledge or respond to purchase orders.
- Fulfilment Rate: Percentage of purchase orders fulfilled without issues.

**Model Design:**
- Add fields to the vendor model to store these performance metrics.

**API Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/vendors/{vendor_id}/performance`: Retrieve a vendor's performance metrics.
